# Umwelt-OS target performance report

Status: measurement pending. Target: 2 CPU cores, 8 GiB RAM, remote inference. No target-host benchmark, workload, OOM, restore or deployment operation was executed during code implementation. Development build success is not capacity evidence.

## Measurement record

Copy and complete this record with actual target-host evidence during deferred acceptance. Unknown values stay null; record enabled optional services and remote placement explicitly. Attach raw measurements and exact source/deployment configuration, without secrets or private dataset content.

## Required workloads

Record collection, indexing, lexical/semantic search, dashboard map/chart/feed rendering, realtime reconnect/replay and grounded Chat with actual enabled profiles. Include service placement, workload overlap, queue delay, provider latency separately from application latency, and resource pressure during recovery/backup if enabled. Do not infer off-host graph/browser placement or silently reduce approved capabilities to obtain a passing result.

## Budget decisions

Keep current deployment limits until measurements justify changes. Record each proposed limit with measured workload, observed peak/headroom and behavior at overload. Worker concurrency or a successful container startup alone cannot prove the target budget. If target hardware or required integration is unavailable, retain this gate as pending and state the missing evidence.

See [release checklist](release-checklist.md) and [deployment](deployment.md). Production report preparation is a P12-T4 artifact; measured capacity and release acceptance remain incomplete.
